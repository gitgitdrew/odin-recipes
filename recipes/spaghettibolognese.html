    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta. Cook for around 10 minutes until the onions start to look translucent.</li>
<li>Add the minced meats and brown all over, ensuring the meat is fully broken up and no large chunks remain.</li>
<li>Add salt and pepper to taste. Increase the heat, add the wine, and allow to evaporate for around 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li>In a large jug, dilute the tomato puree into the chicken stock and add to the pan, stir well.</li>
<li>Reduce to a low heat, then cover and simmer for 2 hours. Check from time to time to ensure the sauce is not drying out. If this occurs, add a small amount of stock.</li>
<li>Cook desired pasta and toss in the bolognese.</li>
<li>Top with parmesan cheese and serve.</li>
